# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Coupon configuration and English localization with the existing sheet schema.
- Deterministic coupon-code detection, source-grounded candidate normalization,
  spreadsheet text escaping, and remote-image URL filtering.
- Complete coupon-token and Gmail-link identity validation, including punctuation
  boundaries, Unicode-aware bounds and evidence for notes; oversized structured
  values are cleared and unknown completeness cannot authorize confirmation.
- Shared HTML text/image traversal excluding comments and script/style content.
- Reserved internal sheet-name and capacity validation across config reloads.
- Recovery dates based on the latest real coupon import in `Europe/Rome`, with
  calendar validation and explicit technical-row filtering.
- Local unit tests and Apps Script syntax and owner-only manifest checks.
